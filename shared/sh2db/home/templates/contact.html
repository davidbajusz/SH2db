    <p>Our research group has been established in 2013 by György M. Keserű on the basis of a preceding synthetic organic chemistry group. Since then we established national and international, government and industry founded research programs focusing on two major topics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>fragment based approaches in the lead discovery of GPCR and kinase targets</li>
        <li>chemical process development for small molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients</li>
    </ul>
